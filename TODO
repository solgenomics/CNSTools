 ✔ @critical finish the phastcons/conservation scripts @done (16-10-24 18:18)
 ☐ @critical make sure the names going into the program (like those in the gff3) match the seqnames in tha fasta file.
 
 ☐ @high make sure config file-taking scripts output appropriate config files for next step in the pipeline. Chromosome folders do not need "results.json"
 ☐ @high transition from filetype_classes (where all data in a file is kept in memory), to file_handler classes (where files are work with line-by-line) this should work for almost everything in the program. For maf/bed intersection: first the maf can be converted to bed. Instead of storing the whole maf, the order of their entries can be store by a unique ID. The the maf_bed can be intersected with bed using bedtools. Then, assuming the bed is in the same order as the original maf (which I would hope it would be), the maf and bed can then be iterated over at the same time to remove the nessicary peices.
 ☐ @high make sure options are available to add scripts to the PATH!!!

 ☐ @low rewrite the pipeline to use only one sequence ID in maf files and keep chromosome information in either the header or the filename until required.
 ☐ @low change how entry modifaction works, make modifications based on entry object modified during iteration, replacements should be performed with Entry.replace(entry/[entries])
 ☐ @low determine a better way to package the program (just as a library but with setup.py? just as a command-line program?)
 ☐ @low try to reduce format switching as much as possible
 ☐ @low try to reduce program to only the commands: alignment, conservation, identification
 ☐ @low ensure these can be done per-chromosome or whole genomes!
